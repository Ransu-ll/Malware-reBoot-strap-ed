# Malware-reBoot-strap-ed
A redesign of a website I made in Year 9 that has used some 2005 version of Dreamweaver. Now made almost completely by hand and utilising the framework Bootstrap.

Here's a link to the website: https://ransu-ll.github.io/Malware-reBoot-strap-ed/index.html

### Things to do:
- Add more images
- Check for any spelling/grammar/punctuation/capitalisation errors/stylisations
- Replace triple break lines with proper margins
- Clean up the code and perhaps add a little more documentation.
- Work out how to not make the entire top a link.
